	"PositioningDescription_1" : "Individual MNI coordinates of the right (and left) hMT+/V5 complex were defined using a visual motion fMRI localiser (https://github.com/cpp-lln-lab/localizer_visual_motion). Functional data was spatially smoothed using a 6-mm full-width half-maximum (FWHM) kernel. A motion vs. static contrast was computed with a paired t-test. Statistical inferences were made at a voxel-level threshold of p < 0.05, family-wise error (FWE)-corrected. Individual right and left peak coordinates for hMT+/V5 in MNI space were input into the neuronavigation software (see participants.tsv for overview of all coordinates). A T1w MRI (/sub-001/ses-mri/anat/sub-001_ses-mri_T1w.nii.gz) was used to reconstruct a 3D model of the brain surface and scalp in the neuronavigation software. At the start of the TMS sessions, the subject’s landmarks (nasion and tragi) and head shape was co-registered with their anatomical image following standard procedures.",
